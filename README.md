# GLASS-metadata

Script to generate dhis2 metadata from google sheets.

## Usage

To use this script we need to create a `.env.local` file in the root
directory of the project. This file will be ignored by git, but
**please be careful with your credentials**.

It should look like this:

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=...
DEFAULT_CATEGORY_COMBO_ID=...
DHIS2_BASE_URL=...
DHIS2_USERNAME=...
DHIS2_PASSWORD=...
UPDATE_CATEGORY_OPTION_COMBOS=false # true or false
UPDATE_SERVER=false # true or false
```

The first time, we have to run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
After that, you can just run `yarn start` to generate and update the metadata.

## Description

We can **create or modify metadata** in dhis2 by simply using the
official `Maintenance` app. But sometimes this is a slow process.

Instead, we can specify the metadata in a spreadsheet with a specific
format, so we can manipulate it quickly, and when we are happy with it
just run this script.

The script will generate a json file containing all the
information that dhis2 needs to update the metadata, and also
connect to a dhis2 server to update the metadata directly.

If you need to generate only the json set the `UPDATE_SERVER` option to `false`.

If you want to manually upload the generated json file to a dhis2 instance,
use its `Import/Export` app, go to `Metadata import` and use `Merge` as
the "import strategy".

If dhis2 fails to automatically update all the category option
combinations (which happens occassionally and is a dhis2 issue), you
can use the `Data Administration` app, go to `Maintenance`, select
`Update category option combinations` and click on the
`Perform Maintenance` button. Alternatively, you can just set in the
`.env.local` file the `UPDATE_CATEGORY_OPTION_COMBOS` option to `true`.

## Default category combo

To get the default `categoryCombo` used at a dhis2 instance, go to the
following endpoint:
`/api/categoryCombos.json?filter=name:eq:default&fields=id,name` .

### How the default category combo is used

If you want to understand what is special about the default category
combination and how it works in dhis2, you can check [this talk by Jim
Grace](https://youtu.be/EcR9QwJvc7c?t=314) (and maybe [these
slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MWq-Nx-AcSSuTfF9z7VPq0W9PXyl9IAn/view)).

It is used at least in `dataElements`, `dataSets`, and `programs`.

## Accessing google spreadsheets

To access the spreadsheets, you need a google _api key_. You can see
how to get one at the [google developers documentation
site](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).

The spreadsheet needs to have sharing permissions with, at least,
anyone that has the link to it (and not only anyone within your
organization). This is necessary because we use an api key to access
the spreadsheet, but we could avoid it if we used OAuth2
authentication (and in that case, we could also write on the
spreadsheet). It would be harder to implement, though, and seems
unnecessary.

## Metadata spreadsheet template

You can find an example spreadsheet to use as a template for
introducing metadata at [Metadata
template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ij0X85_Q0wQQoxelB0VAWl5D0PjtGY_CbjYxQYGN4GE/).

The last sheet it has, called `DHIS2`, is used to created named ranges to use
as data validation (and thus also get drop-down menus in google spreadsheets).

## Extending the script

### Adding new metadata

This script understands only a limited amount of all the metadata that
exist in dhis2.

You can extend it to add other kinds of metadata. For that, you will
need to understand how dhis2 represents those new kind of metadata.

To see what fields will be necessary, you can inspect with your
browser the api calls made when you add new metadata from the
`Maintenance` app.

Another option is to go to one of the servers at
https://play.dhis2.org/ and export its metadata with the
`Import/Export` app. Then, you can for example use `jq` to learn about
it. A few examples follow.

To see the keys present in the top-level object:

```sh
cat metadata.json | jq 'keys_unsorted'
```

To see the first in the list of programRules:

```sh
cat metadata.json | jq '.programRules[0]'
```

To see the paths to all the elements where "programRuleActions" is an
existing field:

```sh
cat metadata.json | jq -c 'paths | select(.[-1] == "programRuleActions")'
```

To see in the programRuleActions for which programRuleActionTypes we can have
a key named "dataElement":

```sh
cat metadata.json \
    | jq -r '.programRuleActions[] | select(.dataElement != null) | .programRuleActionType' \
    | sort | uniq
```

### Comparing metadata files

Comparing metadata json files is useful to see what can be missing or
wrong in the files.

For example, you can compare the files created by this script to
others created by a previous version, or another script, or with the
`Metadata export` option of the `Import/Export` app, or from
the `/api/metadata.json` endpoint.

To compare them, it is useful to have them properly sorted. The
following command helps to make them easy to compare:

```sh
cat metadata.json \
    | jq --sort-keys \
    | jq 'walk(if type == "array" then sort_by(.name) else . end)' \
    > metadata_sorted.json
```
